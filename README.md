# August 2015 Gamemode Competition
Welcome to the official repository for Mod Mountain's August 2015 GMod Gamemode Competition. Here you can find a useful list of resources along with the addons that will be run on the official Mod Mountain servers.

## The Official Addons
We're currently working on coding some nice little addons to help the competition and make things run smoother. Here's what is being coded:
- In-game reviewing, no need to visit Mod Mountain's website
- Server hopper so people can quickly flick through the different gamemodes
- Automatic error reporter because developers will not have access to the Mod Mountain servers
